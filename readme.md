# blackjack:
this is a game made with html, css, and javascript.
it doesn't require anything to be installed.
it was designed with a kind of computer logic based on the asynchronous functions to give th computer the possibility of making a choices on its own, and yeah its logic is very good that it wins most of the time, want to chllenge it? you will lose the 3 fist matches i am warning you.
## how to play:
th egame rules are pretty simple.
press the ``hit`` button, increase your score, and drop your cards however you want, you score is the combination of you cards numbers, then press ``stand`` to let the computer frops his cards, and the closest one 21 one is the winner. pretty simple right??.
and when you are done press deal to start again.
you will be busted if your score is more than 21.

## what did i used:
i use bootstrap in the most of it, you can recognized it in the page style easly, as well as the jQuery to make the popup message that will apprear first thing in the page.
and i added some sounds to make it feel more alive. sure no one like the dead silence in a game.
